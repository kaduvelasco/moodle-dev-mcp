# CLAUDE.md

This file defines the rules and conventions that AI agents must follow when working in this repository.

---

## Rule Priority

When rules conflict, follow this order:

1. **User instructions** — always take precedence.
2. **This file** — applies to all tasks.
3. Existing project conventions.
4. Default AI behavior.

Never override explicit user instructions. If something is unclear, **ask before proceeding**.

---

## Language

| Context | Language |
|---|---|
| Responses to the user | Brazilian Portuguese (pt-BR) |
| Documentation (`*.md`) | English |
| Code comments | English |

Do **not** mix languages inside the same file.

---

## Agent Behavior

- Make **minimal and precise changes**.
- Modify **only files relevant to the task**.
- Respect the **existing project structure**.
- Prefer **simple and readable** solutions.
- Avoid unnecessary refactoring or large rewrites unless explicitly requested.
- If a task requires a large refactor, **ask the user before proceeding**.

---

## Git Operations

AI agents must **never** perform or simulate Git operations. Do not:

- Run `git` commands
- Generate commit messages
- Suggest commits, branches, or pull requests

Version control is handled **manually by the user**. Agents may only **create or modify files**.

---

## Dependencies

Before adding any dependency:

1. Check if the functionality exists in the standard library.
2. Prefer built-in language features.
3. If a dependency is truly required, explain why a built-in solution is insufficient.

Dependencies must be **minimal and justified**.

---

## Code Quality

Generated code must:

- Follow existing project conventions.
- Use clear and consistent naming.
- Prioritize readability over cleverness.
- Avoid unnecessary abstractions and overengineering.

---

## Documentation

All documentation files must follow **GitHub Markdown conventions** and be placed in the **project root** unless instructed otherwise.

### Required files

| File | Language | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `README.md` | English | Main project documentation |
| `LEIAME.md` | Portuguese (pt-BR) | Portuguese translation of README |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md` | English | Contribution guidelines |
| `CONTRIBUINDO.md` | Portuguese (pt-BR) | Portuguese translation of CONTRIBUTING |

Each file must link to its counterpart:

```md
📄 Portuguese version: see LEIAME.md   <!-- in README.md / CONTRIBUTING.md -->
📄 English version: see README.md      <!-- in LEIAME.md / CONTRIBUINDO.md -->
```

### README structure

1. Project title and description
2. Relevant badges (language version, CI, license, coverage — no irrelevant badges)
3. Features
4. Installation
5. Usage
6. Configuration
7. Contributing
8. License (if applicable)

---

## Markdown Signature

Every `*.md` file created in this repository must end with this signature, **exactly once**:

```md
---

Made with ❤️ and AI by [Kadu Velasco](https://github.com/kaduvelasco)
```

---

## Security

AI agents must never:

- Expose credentials, secrets, or API keys.
- Generate or hardcode sensitive information.
- Introduce insecure patterns.

If a task appears to require sensitive information, **ask the user instead of generating it**.

---

## General Principles

- Implement **only what was requested** — avoid scope creep.
- Keep solutions **simple and maintainable**.
- Preserve the existing architecture.
- When in doubt, **ask the user before proceeding**.

## Subagents

Spawn subagents to isolate context, parallelize independent work,
or offload bulk mechanical tasks.

**Spawn when:**
- Tasks are independent and have no shared reasoning.
- A subtask is purely mechanical (formatting, extraction, translation).
- Context isolation would prevent contamination between concerns.

**Do not spawn when:**
- The parent needs to hold the reasoning together.
- Synthesis requires cross-task judgment.
- Spawn overhead dominates the actual work.

**Model selection — pick the least capable model that can do the job well:**

| Capability needed | Tier |
|---|---|
| Bulk mechanical, no judgment | Lightweight (e.g. Haiku) |
| Scoped research, code tasks, in-scope synthesis | Standard (e.g. Sonnet) |
| Planning, tradeoffs, complex reasoning | Advanced (e.g. Opus) |

If a subtask turns out to need more capability than its assigned model,
the subagent must signal that to the parent — not attempt to compensate.

## Language-Specific Standards

@instructions/MCP.md

<!-- code-review-graph MCP tools -->
## MCP Tools: code-review-graph

**IMPORTANT: This project has a knowledge graph. ALWAYS use the
code-review-graph MCP tools BEFORE using Grep/Glob/Read to explore
the codebase.** The graph is faster, cheaper (fewer tokens), and gives
you structural context (callers, dependents, test coverage) that file
scanning cannot.

### When to use graph tools FIRST

- **Exploring code**: `semantic_search_nodes` or `query_graph` instead of Grep
- **Understanding impact**: `get_impact_radius` instead of manually tracing imports
- **Code review**: `detect_changes` + `get_review_context` instead of reading entire files
- **Finding relationships**: `query_graph` with callers_of/callees_of/imports_of/tests_for
- **Architecture questions**: `get_architecture_overview` + `list_communities`

Fall back to Grep/Glob/Read **only** when the graph doesn't cover what you need.

### Key Tools

| Tool | Use when |
|------|----------|
| `detect_changes` | Reviewing code changes — gives risk-scored analysis |
| `get_review_context` | Need source snippets for review — token-efficient |
| `get_impact_radius` | Understanding blast radius of a change |
| `get_affected_flows` | Finding which execution paths are impacted |
| `query_graph` | Tracing callers, callees, imports, tests, dependencies |
| `semantic_search_nodes` | Finding functions/classes by name or keyword |
| `get_architecture_overview` | Understanding high-level codebase structure |
| `refactor_tool` | Planning renames, finding dead code |

### Workflow

1. The graph auto-updates on file changes (via hooks).
2. Use `detect_changes` for code review.
3. Use `get_affected_flows` to understand impact.
4. Use `query_graph` pattern="tests_for" to check coverage.
